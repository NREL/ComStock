# NREL Staff Instructions for Running ComStock on NREL's Supercomputer

## Permissions Dependencies
 - Request an [HPC account](https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/user-accounts.html)
   - When asked for allocation in the request portal, use 'cscore' for ComStock or 'enduse' for EULP
 - Get added to specific allocations.  Contact Ry Horsey for ComStock 'cscore' or Anthony Fontanini for EULP 'enduse' permissions.
   - Recommend requesting access to both to be able to access buildstock environment in the enduse folder on Eagle.
 - If uploading results to S3, Athena, ask Noel for an S3 account
   - Setup MFA on your AWS account
   - Under the security tab, create API access keys.  You'll need one for Eagle and one for your local machine if you plan to process results.
   - Add AWS credentials in Eagle using ```aws configure```.  Add your access key and secret key.
   - Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) on your machine and set credentials in command line with ```aws configure```.
   - You may need to create a folder called ```.aws``` on Eagle in your /home/username/ folder. Inside ```.aws``` folder, you will then create a folder called ```credentials```. Inside the ```credentials``` folder, create a file called ```config``` and a file called ```credentials```.
     - Inside the ```config``` file,  type
       ```
       [default]
       region = us-west-2
     - Inside the ```credentials``` file, type
       ```
       [default]
       aws_access_key_id = insert_aws_access_key
       aws_secret_access_key = insert_aws_secret_key
   - If you dont have access to RES AWS RESBLDG in your account reach out to Andrew Parker or Ry Horsey

## Software Dependencies
 - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) to transfer files to/from HPC
 - A linux-based command line tool such as [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), or [Ubuntu for Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview).  You will likely need to have an NREL IT admin install this for you as these require elevated permissions.  Install using your NREL microsoft account. The most broadly used (and thus supported) approach is to install the [Windows subsystem for linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and then [setup a connection from there to Docker for Windows](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly). This isn't required, however not doing so will lead to you having to do some independent learning sooner or later on the quirks of Windows and Docker.

## Accessing HPC
To run commands, use Git Bash or Ubuntu terminal:
 - ```ssh username@hostname``` (e.g. ```ssh mprapros@el.hpc.nrel.gov```)
 - Enter Eagle password

To just access files, use WinSCP:
 - Host name: el.hpc.nrel.gov, el1.hpc.nrel.gov, el2.hpc.nrel.gov, el3.hpc.nrel.gov
 - Username: NREL username (e.g. mprapros)
 - Password: Eagle PW

## ComStock
 - Run documents for ComStock-funded projects located in ```/projects/comstock/``` or ```/projects/enduse/comstock/```
   - If using ComStock for another project, you may need to use another folder depending on what allocation is being used
 - Exception: openstudio-standards singularity containers located in ```/shared-projects/buildstock/singularity_images/```
 - The ComStock Eagle folder contains:
   - ```envs```
     - buildstockbatch conda environment
     - [Developer installation instructions](http://buildstock-batch.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/installation.html#developer-installation)
     - Build in development mode (add -d) â€“ able to make changes
   - ```repos```
     - ```buildstockbatch```. Run and manage batch simulations for stock modeling; commercial equivalent of OpenStudio-BuildStock
     - ```comstock```. All measures and resources related to ComStock
     - ```vizstock-upload```. Process and upload ComStock results from Eagle for use in VizStock
   - ```samples```. Contains all the *buildstock.csv* files
   - ```singularity_images```. openstudio-standards singularity containers
     - buildstockbatch conda environment
   - ```weather```. Zip folders of weather files
     - *!!!Must contain an empty.ddy, empty.epw, and empty.stat file!!!*
   - ```ymls```. yml files outlining conditions for simulation

## Folder Structure Guidelines:
- repos
  - Shared repos will be stored here (i.e. buildstockbatch, comstock, vizstock)
  - Clone the repo you are working in using this command: git clone [http://github.com/nrel/\*repo-name\*.git](http://github.com/nrel/*repo-name*.git)
  - If there are multiple ComStock runs going at once, especially from different branches, use caution and communicate with the team members because checking out another branch it will affect other runs
  - You could clone two versions of the same repo, therefore they can run simultaneously off of separate branches
- samples
  - NEW: Inside the samples folder, put your buildstock samples within the correct project folder, or create a new project folder. This will make it easier to find samples.
- runs
  - NEW: Inside the runs folder, output your runs into the correct project folder, or create a new project folder. This will limit the number of folders in the /enduse/comstock directory
  - Try to keep a standard naming convention for your runs
- ymls
  - NEW: Inside the ymls folder, put your yml file into the correct project folder, or create a new project folder. This will make it easier to find yml files.
  - Make sure everything if you are copying an old yml file that you update the folder locations as necessary.
- weather
  - Shared weather zip files will be stored here
- envs
  - Shared buildstockbatch environments will be stored here

```
Notes:
 - ```schema_version```: always "0.3"
 - ```buildstock_directory``` points to the ComStock repo you are using
 - ```project_directory```: always "national"
 - ```output_directory``` name (your choice) and location (/comstock/runs/*your_project_name*) of output directory
 - ```weather_files_path:``` points to the weather zip

 - ```sampler```:
   -   ```type```: always "precomputed"
   -   ```args```:
     - ```sample_file```: points to correct buildstock.csv in /samples/*project_name* folder

 - ```eagle```:
   - ```account```: eagle allocation for project (e.g. enduse)
   - ```n_jobs```: estimate based on number of datapoints x number of upgrades (number of jobs necessary roughly equal to total number of simulations divided by 1500-2000)
   - ```minutes_per_sim```: 30-60 usually sufficient for most runs; use 120-200 for runs with scout component loads measure
   - ```postprocessing```:
     - ```time```: typically 100-200 is sufficient, but can bump up for larger runs

 - ```postprocessing```:
   - ```keep_individual_timeseries```: true or false depending on if you need timeseries results
   - ```aws```:
     - ```region_name```: always "us-west-2"
     - ```s3```:
       - ```bucket```: depends on what project it's for; ask Noel if you're not sure (e.g. "eulp")
       - ```prefix```: name in a way that you can easily find it on S3; try to keep consistent organization structure for all runs within a project (e.g. "simulation_output/regional_runs/comstock/com_segmentation_full/")

   - ```custom_gems```: always "True"

 - ```os_version```: name of singularity container being used
 - ```os_sha```: OS version used to build singularity container; most existing containers are "3472e8b799" but this could change with newer containers
 - ```workflow_generator```: this section outlines which rpeorting measures are run with the simulation and it can for the most part stay the same. The only time you would need to modify this section is if you are adding a reporting measure (i.e. scout component loads measure). To add a measure, follow this format:
   - ```measure_dir_name```: *measure name*
     - ```arguments:```
       - ```*argument 1 name*```: *argument 1 input*
       - ```*argument 2 name*```: *argument 2 input* and so on

 - ```upgrades```: if you are running upgrade measures, add them here in this format:
   - ```upgrade_name```: your choice; description of upgrade
     - ```options:```
       - ```option```: *parameter name*|*option name* #(from options_lookup.tsv)

## Running a Simulation
### Setup
 1. Activate conda environment:
    ```
    module load conda
    source activate *path to buildstock environment you are using*
    ```
    example:
    ```
    module load conda
    source activate /projects/enduse/comstock/envs/buildstock-com/
    ```

 2. Check to make sure you are using the latest singularity image and that your yml points to this image:
    - Located in ```shared-projects/buildstock/singularity_image```
 3. Make sure you commit all of your changes, push them to github, and pull changes onto eagle
    - navigate to ```/projects/enduse/comstock/repos/comstock``` (or whatever repo you're running from)
    - if not already initialized use ```git init``` (reinitalizes the existing repo)
    - ```git status```
    - ```git fetch```
    - if not already on branch you want to use ```git checkout *branch name*```
    - ```git pull```
 4. If you added any upgrade measures to the ComStock repo (```/comstock/resources/measures/``` folder), make sure you also added them to yml file and the options_lookup.tsv
    - ```yml``` (see formatting above)
    - ```options_lookup```:
      - Parameter Name: your choice; must match yml
      - Option Name: your choice; must match yml
      - Measure Dir: name of measure folder
      - Measure Args: measure arguments and values from measure.rb
      - Example:
        ```
        | Parameter Name        | Option Name          | Measure Dir    | Measure Arg 1 | Measure Arg 2      |
        | env_wall_insul_r_val  | wall_insul_efficient | env_wall_insul | r_val=30.0    | allow_reduct=false |
        ```
  5. If you made any changes to the options_lookup, make sure it is copied into both locations in the comstock repo:
     - ```comstock/national/housing_characteristics/```
     - ```comstock/resources/```
  6. If you added any reporting measures (to the comstock/measures/ folder), make sure you also added them to the yml file
     - yml format for reporting measures (see formatting above)
  7. Double check that your yml is pointing to all the right locations for the sample, repo, weather, and output folder

### Running a job
  - In terminal, navigate to ```/projects/enduse/comstock/ymls/*project name*```
  - Make sure your desired conda environment is activated (see above)
  - ```buildstock_eagle name_of_yml.yml```
  - If it is a small run and you want it to get done quickly, you can use high priority nodes:
    - ```buildstock_eagle --hipri name_of_yml.yml```
    - Avoid using hipri for larger runs, as we only get a certain amount of hipri nodes per allocation
  - If you need to rerun the postprocessing for certain run (e.g. the results.csv files did not populate), you can rerun only the post processing:
    - ```buildstock_eagle --postprocessonly name_of_yml.yml```
  - [Monitoring your runs]
    - Commands for check status of jobs, estimated start time, queue length, cancel jobs, etc. can be found at (https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/eagle-monitor-control-commands.html)
    - Navigate to your run output folder and open the job.out files
      - Shows number of simulations that have completed, elapsed time, etc.
  -  *NEW* [Manually killing a job]
    - Sometimes (especially in really large runs), a few buildings can get stuck during the simulation (e.g. something is not converging or stuck in a loop)
    - If the job reaches its maximum time and a few buildings did not finish, it will wipe the results for all buildings in that job.
    - To avoid this, we can manually go into the job and kill the openstudio task, forcing the hanging buildings to fail and the job completes without wiping all the simulations
    - If you notice a job.out file has been hanging for several hours without updating:
      - ```squeue -u *your HPC username*```: lists your active jobs; job names should look something like r_i_n_ (e.g. r1i7n35)
      - ```ssh *job name*```: going into a specific job to see what its doing
      - ```htop```: allows you to see what tasks the job is currently working on; if there are a few buildings stuck, you'll see most of the nodes do not have any activity, but a few are working on "openstudio" tasks
      - ```exit```: exits htop
      - ```pkill -f openstudio```: force kills all openstudio tasks within that job
      - ```exit```: exits out of job back into normal eagle interface
   - After ~30 seconds, if you return to your job.out file, you should see that it has now completed and post processing should begin soon

### Looking at your results
- Run output folder:
  - ```housing_characteristics``` folder â€“ contains buildstock.csv and options_lookup.tsv used in simulation
    - If your simulations failed due to an options_lookup error, this is a good place to start - make sure the options lookup used in the simulation is the one you were expecting it to use
  - ```results``` folder:
    - ```parquet``` folder â€“ timeseries parquet file
    - ```results_csvs``` folder â€“ results csv files, one for each upgrade
      - Baseline is up00, each subsequent upgrade is up01, up02, etc., in the order they are listed in the yml file
      - If no results csv files are present, this usually means all datapoints failed
      - Occasionally, the postprocessing errors out and you just need to rerun the postprocessing; check the ```postprocessing.out``` file in the run directory
      - If you want to check why a building failed, you will need to check individual simulation logs located in the simulation_output folder
    - ```simulation_output``` folder â€“ individual simulation results for all buildings and all upgrades
      - to view the datapoint log for a specific buildingid and jobid (located in results.csv, first and second columns), you will need to extract a building from the tar.gz file
        - ```tar xvzf simulations_job*jobid*.tar.gz ./up*upgrade_number*/bldg*buildingid*```
        - buildingid must contain 7 digits, so you will need to add leading zeros (e.g. buildingid is "156", you will input "0000156"
        - example: jobid = 1, buildingid = 12, upgrade = 01
          - ```tar xvzf simulations_job1.tar.gz ./up01/bldg0000012```
  - weather folder â€“ contains weather files used

## Common Errors and Mistakes
 - Making changes to the ```options_lookup``` and not copying it into both locations
 - ```n_datapoints``` in yml does not match number of datapoints in ```buildstock.csv```
 - Weather zip folder doesn't contain "empty" weather files
 - Change the output directory name in the yml or delete the old output directory if you need to run the same yml again
 - Permission denied â€“ you don't have read/write permissions for a specific file or directory.
   - Use [chmod and chown](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/chown-chmod-permissions) to change permissions.  You may need to contact the original creator of the file or directory.
   - ```chmod 770 name_of_file```
 - InvalidQOS â€“ you ran out of hipri nodes
 - Invalid account or account/partition â€“ you don't have access to the HPC allocation
   - Run ```groups``` command to see which allocations you have access to
 - Try not to make too many changes directly in Eagle; those changes will be overwritten next time you pull in changes from Github
  - It's okay to make very small changes for testing in Eagle, but when you get it to work, make those same changes in Github so they don't get lost
