    return "This energy efficiency degradation measure applies a performance degradation factor to all existing DX heating and cooling coils in a model, representing the estimated impact of a 30 percent refrigerant undercharge scenario. An estimated degradation of the coil's rated COP equal to 11.02 percent for cooling and 8.24 percent for heating is applied. The values for the degradation factors are based on research work recently performed by NIST in collaboration with ACCA and published under IEA Annex 36 in 2015. NOTE: This measure WILL NOT CONSERVE ENERGY, but will rather the modified objects will use MORE ENERGY then the base systems."
