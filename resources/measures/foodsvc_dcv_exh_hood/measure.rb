  def description
    return 'Kitchen exhaust fans are operated at maximum power for long periods of time, even when there is low kitchen activity. With DCV, a variable frequency drive allows the motor speed and outdoor air intake of an exhaust fan to be reduced below maximum when there is low cooking activity. DCV systems typically incorporate sensors on and around the exhaust hood to detect cooking activity either by temperature or the presence of smoke, steam, or other cooking byproducts. This measure adjusts the exhaust fan schedule based on the kitchen occupancy schedule, such that the fan power is reduced when kitchen occupancy (and thus cooking activity) is low.'

  def modeler_description
    return 'For building with a kitchen space type, find the kitchen occupancy schedule. Clone and rename. Loop through the schedule values and generate a new DCV Exhaust Fan Schedule based on the following logic: if occ=0, exh=0; if occ=0.01-0.49, exh=0.83; if occ=0.5-0.79, exh=0.9; if occ=0.8-0.94, exh=0.95; if occ=0.95-1, exh=1. The exhaust fan schedule represents the fraction of maximum fan speed, which is proportional to the cubic root of fan power (i.e. a 10% reduction in fan speed = 28% reduction in power). Replace the existing exhaust fan schedule with the new DCV Exhaust Fan Schedule.'
