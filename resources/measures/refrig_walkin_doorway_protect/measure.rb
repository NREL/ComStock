# Strip curtains were modeled using the correspondent field in EnergyPlus.
# In order to model automatic door closers, the "door opening fraction" field was modified.
# The literature was consulted and some research was performed but no typical opening reduction factor was found to be associated to
# an automatic door closer. Therefore the value was set to half of the current default value,
# in order to account for the opening reduction given by the automatic door closer.
