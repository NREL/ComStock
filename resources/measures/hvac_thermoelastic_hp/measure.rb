When exposed to the surroundings, it absorbs heat and returns to the original shape.  Researchers have prototyped air conditioning equipment based on this concept.  It is estimated that cooling equipment based on this technology can realistically achieve a COP of around 6, which is roughly twice as good as existing vapor compression technologies.'
