    return 'Some buildings use a constant supply-air (also referred to discharge-air) temperature set point of 55F. When a buildings supply fan system is operational, the supply-air temperature set point value should be automatically adjusting to internal/external conditions that will allow the supply fan to operate more efficiently. The simplest way to implement this strategy is to raise supply-air temperature when the outdoor air is cold and the building is less likely to need cooling.  Supplying this warmer air to the  terminals decreases the amount of reheat necessary at the terminal, saving heating energy.'
