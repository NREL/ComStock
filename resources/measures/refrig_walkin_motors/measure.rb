# In order to calculate the number of fans (and consequently of motors) per walkin, multiple cut sheets were considered, such as:
# http://www.midstatesrefrigsupply.com/assets/bn-tb-uc-walkin-mp2.pdf
# http://www.omniteaminc.com/catalog/adt_let.pdf
# The ratio between Cooling load (Btu/h) and number of fans is variable and the is no clear pattern.
# The following rations were assumed to calculate the number of motors per walkin, for low temperature and medium temperature respectively.
# LT: 10000 Btu/h/fan
# MT: 4000 Btu/h/fan
