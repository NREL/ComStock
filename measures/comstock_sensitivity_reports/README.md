# ComStock_Sensitivity_Reports

## Description
In order to train the surrogate model for ComStock, we need to have more summary information about the
            building in the output csv.  Characteristics like whole-bldg avg. U-value for walls, roofs, windows, etc,
            whole-bldg LPD and EPD, avg. htg. eff/clg COP.  Mainly things that are not direct inputs to the model, but
            that are a byproduct of the other inputs.  Also, the focus should be on things that are common across
            building types, as opposed to very building-type-specific characteristics.

## Modeler Description
