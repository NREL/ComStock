The base cost of power (U) is $0.0537 per kilowatt-hour. \r\n\r\nParallel Generation (20 kW or less) Net Energy Billing - Available for single-phase and three-phase customers where a part or all of the electrical requirements of the customer are supplied by the customer's generating facilities, where such facilities have a total generating capability of 20 kW or less, where such facilities are connected in parallel with the utility and where such facilities are approved by the utility. Rate: The customer shall be billed monthly on a net energy basis and shall pay the fixed charge and energy charge specified in the rate schedule under which he is served. If, in any month, the customer's bill has a credit balance of $25 or less, the amount shall be credited to subsequent bills until a debit balance is reestablished. If the credit balance is more than $25, the utility shall reimburse the customer by check upon request. Monthly credits shall be computed by taking the net excess kilowatt-hours produced times the sum of the applicable energy charge plus monthly power cost adjustment clause (PCAC).  \r\nThis rate will be applied to single and three-phase customers. This includes commercial, institutional, government, farm, and other customers.\r\n\r\nFixed Monthly Charge includes Commitment to Community Rider:$1.34 per customer per month.", "dgrules": "Net Metering", "eiaid": 12336, "energyratestructure": [[{"rate": 0.0771, "sell": 0.0771, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 11.34, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "539fc75aec4f024d2f53dade", "name": "Gs-1 General Service Three Phase with Parallel Generation(20kW or less)", "phasewiring": "3-Phase", "revisions": [1343153597, 1343153683, 1354935232, 1402083652, 1406712536, 1427405182], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "www.merrillan.net/utilities/documents/Merrillan_Electric_Utility_Tariffs.pdf", "sourceparent": "http://www.merrillan.net/utilities/electric.htm", "startdate": 1211270400, "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/539fc75aec4f024d2f53dade", "utility": "Village of Merrillan, Wisconsin (Utility Company)"}
