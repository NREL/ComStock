Throughout the year, our power supplier Prairie Power Inc. (PPI) may call a Load Control Period in an effort to avoid high cost periods of market energy or to lower monthly Supplemental Demand charges or to lower the cost of monthly transmission service. The actual cost savings resulting from these load control actions will not be determined until the end of the month, when all wholesale energy and transmission providers have submitted their billing invoices. MEC will calculate the actual reduction in the PPI monthly power bill that was caused by the individual member's reduction in demand and energy and credit to the member's account 90% of the actual savings that MEC received from its power suppliers.\nThe Cooperative will install metering equipment that is capable of permanently recording demands at 15 minute intervals. All costs of special metering equipment, including labor and materials, shall be paid by the member in a one-time, non-refundable contribution-in-aid of construction.\n\nLARGE LOAD DIVERSITY CREDIT:\nThis credit is available to Large Load members who have a measured hour-long\nmaximum demand equal to or in excess of 1000 kW during the current month.\n\nLarge Load Diversity Credit = Diversity kW @ - $2.50 per kW\n\nDiversity kW = The member's maximum hour-long kW peak for the current month, less\nthe greater of the member's kW demand coincident with either: the hour of the\nCooperative's wholesale power suppliers monthly supplemental peak or the hour of the\nCooperative's wholesale power suppliers transmission peak.", "eiaid": 12395, "energyratestructure": [[{"max": 200, "rate": 0.075, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"max": 400, "rate": 0.064, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"rate": 0.062, "unit": "kWh/kW"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 95, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"rate": 12.25}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "539f6bceec4f024411eca1e9", "name": "Interruptible \u00a0Large Power Service (Rate Code 31)", "phasewiring": "Single and 3-Phase", "revisions": [1338820464, 1338820606, 1339598745, 1339598795, 1339598841, 1354952606, 1400686144, 1402926773, 1402927145, 1427405218], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "http://menard.coopwebbuilder.com/sites/menard.coopwebbuilder.com/files/rc31_interruptiblelargepower.pdf", "sourceparent": "http://www.menard.com/content/your-bill-our-rates", "startdate": 1391263200, "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/539f6bceec4f024411eca1e9", "utility": "Menard Electric Coop"}
