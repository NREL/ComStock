This rate schedule is for single- and three-phase, sixty-hertz, electricity for general service supplied to the customer at 240 volts and higher. Generally, three-phase service is only available from an existing three-phase distribution line. The Electric Department provides and maintains all transformers and associated equipment.\n\nF. Primary service provision.\n(1) Three-phase service is available from the Borough's twelve-thousand-volt lines for loads in excess of 500 kilowatts and at the approval of the Electric Department. For such service the customer provides and maintains all necessary switches, protective equipment, transformers and other associated equipment.\n(2) The Electric Department reserves the right to install the necessary metering instruments on the secondary side of the customer's transformers, and when so installed, the billing kilowatts and kilowatt-hours shall be adjusted so as to reflect the customer's demand and energy losses of the transforming equipment.\nG.
