Consumer's currently receiving service under this schedule, whose demands have fallen below 50 kW, for 12 consecutive months, will have the option of remaining on this schedule or moving to the Small General Service schedule, up until such time the consumer's maximum demand does not exceed 40 kW. At such time that the consumer's maximum demand does not exceed 40 kW for a consecutive 12-month period, the consumer will automatically be moved to the Small General Service schedule. Service under this schedule is subject to the Cooperative's established Service Rules and Regulations.\r\n   \r\n\r\nIn cases where the consumer connects a highly fluctuating or intermittent load to the Cooperative's system that requires the Cooperative to install facilities over and above those required to serve a normal load, the Cooperative may charge an \"Extra Facility Charge\" over and above the charge shown below. If a load is determined to be a highly fluctuating or intermittent load, the \"Extra Facility Charge\" shall be $1.75 per kVA for each kVA of transformer capacity installed to maintain proper voltage with the highly fluctuating or intermittent load less the estimated kVA of transformer capacity that would have been installed without the highly fluctuating or intermittent load.\r\n\r\nRates are subject to Power Factor Adjustments and Wholesale Power Adjustments, as well as any applicable North Carolina State and local sales taxes. \r\n\r\nThe NCGreenPower Service Rider is applicable to this rate.", "eiaid": 3250, "energyratestructure": [[{"max": 219, "rate": 0.0627, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"max": 438, "rate": 0.0578, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"rate": 0.0538, "unit": "kWh/kW"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 85, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"rate": 5.75}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "55538ae15457a3012d8b456b", "name": "Medium General Service Single Phase", "phasewiring": "Single Phase", "revisions": [1431516801, 1431516878, 1432202291], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "http://www.centralelectriconline.com/page.php?p=7&s=80", "startdate": 1431504000, "supersedes": "539fbf6aec4f024c27d890e3", "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/55538ae15457a3012d8b456b", "utility": "Central Electric Membership Corporation"}
