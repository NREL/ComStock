The Company undertakes to provide the necessary facilities for a supply of electric power from its primary distribution system at the contract capacity. Any single reading of the demand meter in any month that exceeds the contract capacity then in effect shall become the new contract capacity. The contract capacity for customers served at more than one voltage level shall be the sum of the contract capacities established for each voltage level. Substation Credit: Available to customers where service at sub-transmission voltage level (24 to 41.6 kV) or higher is required, who provide the on-site substation including all necessary transforming, controlling and protective equipment. A credit of $.30 per kW of maximum demand shall be applied to the maximum demand charge.
