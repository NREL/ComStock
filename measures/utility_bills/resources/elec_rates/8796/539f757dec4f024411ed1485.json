A customer may be transferred from this rate if the customer's average monthly usage for 3 consecutive months is greater than 10,000 kWh/month, or greater than 500 kW of demand.\r\n\r\n*MINIMUM CHARGE: The minimum bill is $10.25 per month.\r\n\r\n*POWER COST ADJUSTMENT: The rate(s) will be adjusted in accordance with the HMLP's Power Cost Adjustment. The adjustment rate shall be calculated to the nearest thousandth of a cent ($.00001) in the following manner:\r\n    A - Total Purchased Power cost including NEPOOL interchange  \r\n        charge to Accounts 555, 556,557 and 565 (*) for the \r\n        period plus the NYPA savings calculated pursuant \r\n        to Schedule NYPA, all  divided by: \r\n    B - Estimated kWhs to be sold during the period will be \r\n        compared to:\r\n    C - Base period cost of purchased power per kWh sold.\r\nThe difference between the base cost and the annual cost per kWh estimated to be sold will be applied in the billing period. The Power Cost Adjustment will be calculated as follows                    \r\n                 PCA = A/B - C\r\nThis calculation will normally be made on a quarterly basis and a single Power Cost Adjustment billed for the entire quarter, although HMLP may change the Power Cost Adjustment more frequently if such changes are required.", "eiaid": 8796, "energyratestructure": [[{"rate": 0.1514, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 10.25, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "539f757dec4f024411ed1485", "name": "SCHEDULE G-1 SMALL GENERAL SERVICE", "revisions": [1337805464, 1337805561, 1340306459, 1340306551, 1354882307, 1402332795, 1402332835, 1408696702, 1427405193], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "http://www.hmlp.com/RatesBilling/Documents/G-1.pdf", "sourceparent": "https://hmlp.com/RatesBilling/CommercialIndustrial.asp", "startdate": 1230800400, "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/539f757dec4f024411ed1485", "utility": "City of Hingham, Massachusetts (Utility Company)"}
