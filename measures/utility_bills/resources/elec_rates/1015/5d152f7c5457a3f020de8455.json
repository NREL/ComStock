Demand data will be reviewed annually in October. Customers will be assigned to their\r\nappropriate class and will charged the corresponding appropriate rates beginning on January 1.\r\nThese rates shall apply for not less than twelve months following Austin Energy&#x;fffds determination that\r\ncustomer&#x;fffds average summer (June through September) metered peak demand level places customer in\r\nthis rate class. The twelve month requirement may be waived by Austin Energy if a customer has made\r\nsignificant changes in their connected load, which prevents the customer from meeting or exceeding the\r\nminimum-metered demand threshold of this rate schedule, and Austin Energy has verified these changes.", "dgrules": "Net Metering", "eiaid": 1015, "enddate": 1635667200, "energycomments": "Adjustments = Power Supply adjustment + Regulatory charge + Community Benefit charges", "energyratestructure": [[{"adj": 0.03288, "rate": 0.01902, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 71.5, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"adj": 8.24, "rate": 6.4}], [{"adj": 8.24, "rate": 6.4}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "is_default": false, "label": "5d152f7c5457a3f020de8455", "name": "Commercial - Secondary Voltage Greater than 300kW - Outside Austin", "peakkwcapacitymin": 300, "revisions": [1561647900, 1561647956, 1657544363], "sector": "Commercial", "servicetype": "Bundled", "source": "https://austinenergy.com/wcm/connect/e269c3f9-e09b-40eb-9afc-3b9abc24b67c/general-service.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=lZU-BOF&CVID=lZU-BOF&CVID=lZU-BOF", "sourceparent": "https://austinenergy.com/ae/rates/approved-rates-schedules/approved-rates-schedules-for-city-of-austin", "startdate": 1541059200, "supersedes": "5ae796675457a33462a3d164", "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/5d152f7c5457a3f020de8455", "utility": "Austin Energy", "voltagecategory": "Secondary"}
