If a customer has insufficient usage history to determine the appropriate rate schedule, Austin Energy\r\nwill place the customer in the appropriate class. Demand data will be reviewed annually in October.\r\nCustomers will be assigned to their appropriate class and will charged the corresponding appropriate rates\r\nbeginning on January 1.\r\nThese rates shall apply for not less than twelve months following Austin Energy&#x;fffds determination that\r\ncustomer&#x;fffds average summer (June through September) metered peak demand level places customer in\r\nthis rate class. The twelve month requirement may be waived by Austin Energy if a customer has made\r\nsignificant changes in their connected load, which prevents the customer from meeting or exceeding the\r\nminimum-metered kW threshold of this rate schedule, and Austin Energy has verified these changes.
