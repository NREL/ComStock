{"approved": true, "country": "USA", "demandrateunit": "kW", "demandunits": "kW", "description": "This Rider is available only to a Customer who operates a solar photovoltaic, wind-powered, or biomass-fueled generating system. The Customer must have electric consumption billed under an appropriate time-of-use rate. The rated output (ac) capacity of the generating system shall not exceed 10 kilowatts for a residential system. For a non-residential system the rated output (ac) capacity of the system shall not exceed the lesser of the Customer's annual maximum demand or 94 kilowatts. The generating system that is connected in parallel operation with service from Town and located on Customer's premises must be manufactured, installed and operated in accordance with governmental and industry standards and must fully conform with the Town's applicable Renewable Energy Interconnecting Interface Criteria. Metering of the renewable energy produced by the qualified facility must be separate from all premises consumption and installed in accordance with the requirements of the Town.\n\n\nThis Rider is available on a first-come, first-served basis, except that the aggregate capacity of Customer owned renewable energy generators shall not exceed 5% of Town's peak load for the prior calendar year. If a Customer's proposed installation results in exceeding the limit, the Customer will be notified that service under this Rider will not be allowed.", "eiaid": 3731, "enddate": 1372600800, "energyratestructure": [[{"rate": 0.0487, "unit": "kWh"}], [{"rate": 0.1534, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "label": "539fbd58ec4f024c27d87a5d", "name": "BILATERAL METERING FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES RIDER TOU", "revisions": [1334767068, 1334767636, 1334772377, 1338393689, 1338393766, 1341869146, 1354891371, 1427405219], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "http://www.townofclaytonnc.org/client_resources/government/comprlistoffees.pdf", "startdate": 1341151200, "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/539fbd58ec4f024c27d87a5d", "utility": "Town of Clayton, North Carolina (Utility Company)"}
