{"approved": true, "country": "USA", "demandunits": "kW", "description": "The rate is designed for customers who can readily switch a substantial portion of their service from daytime operation to nighttime operation, thereby contributing to a reduction of system peak. The service is available on an optional basis for a minimum of one year.\r\nSpecial dual register meters are required to separate daytime service from nighttime service during the designated hours. The additional cost for the dual register meter will be charged to the customer in the form of a higher monthly customer charge. The off-peak period includes all hours on weekends and weekdays between the nighttime hours of 8:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M. CST. The following holidays will be considered off-peak: New Years Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve Day and Christmas Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Charges are formula based as follows:   Customer Charge + Incremental Billing Charge + Energy Charge + (Energy Charge * % of energy on off peak * 0.5) + (Energy Charge * % of energy on on peak * 1.5). Customer Charge: $80. Incremental Billing Charge: $2. Demand Charge First 50 kW summer: $14.95/kW. Excess kW summer: $10.50/kW. First 50 kW winter: $12.95/kW. Excess kW: $8.25/kW.  Energy Charge: First 250 kWh per kW= $0.064/kWh/kW.  Excess kWh per kW= $0.039/kWh/kW.\r\n\r\nPrimary metering discount is available to the customer receiving service metered at primary voltage. The energy billing shall be discounted three (3) percent as metered at primary voltage. Separate billings shall be applied to each point of delivery if service is taken at more than one location. If Waverly Light and Power changes its primary system voltage, the customer must change their voltage as well. Waverly Light and Power will give a minimum of one-year notice prior to the upgrade.\r\n\r\nRider for customer ownership of transformers:\r\nDiscount is available to the customer receiving service at primary voltage to customer-owned transformation. A discount of five (5) cents per kilowatt will be applied to the customer's demand billing", "eiaid": 20214, "energycomments": "Special dual register meters are required to separate daytime service from nighttime service during the designated hours.
