See description for more details.", "demandrateunit": "kW", "demandunits": "kW", "description": "All service will be provided through one (1) (set of) compound watt-hour and demand meter(s) \r\nfor each delivery point.  A delivery point is defined as the point of metering from which the customer \r\nreceives service from Company's secondary or primary distribution system.  Customers receiving \r\nservice at more than one (1) voltage level will be treated as multiple customers for billing purposes. \r\nThis rate is not applicable for standby, breakdown, supplementary, maintenance or resale \r\nservice except as noted below. \r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF SERVICE \r\nSingle-phase, 60 Hertz, nominally 120/240 volt firm electric service, provided from the \r\nCompany's secondary distribution system.  Three-phase secondary service shall be available where \r\nthree-phase facilities are available without additional construction or may be made available at \r\nadditional charge at voltages not exceeding 480 volts.  Three-phase primary distribution service shall \r\nbe available where primary distribution facilities are available without additional construction or may be \r\nmade available at additional charge at 2,400,  12,470, or 24,900 nominal volts.  Primary service may be \r\nserved from Company's 69,000 volt or 34,500 volt systems, at Company's option, through Company \r\nowned transformation.  The customer may request contractual service from the 69,000 volt or 34,500 \r\nvolt systems, if such systems are available at the customer's point of delivery without additional \r\nconstruction, and the customer provides transformation. \r\n\r\nANNUAL BASE DEMAND\r\nThe annual base demand shall be the lesser of (a) 100% of the customer's measured demand\r\nduring the preceding May billing month, or (b) 100% of the customer's measured demand during the\r\npreceding October billing month, or (c) 65% ofthe maximum measured demand established during the\r\npreceding four (4) summer billing months. Company will determine the annual base demand each year\r\nprior to the October billing month to be used for the following twelve (12) billing months. Company will\r\nestimate the annual base demand for customers who have insufficient billing history.\r\n\r\nMONTHLY BASE BILLING DEMAND AND SEASONAL BILLING DEMAND\r\nThe monthly billing demand shall be the customer's maximum fifteen (15) minute integrated\r\ndemand measured during the month, but in no event less than five hundred (500) kW. The monthly\r\nseasonal billing demand shall be the monthly measured demand in excess of the customer's annual\r\nbase demand. The monthly base billing demand shall be the monthly billing demand in excess of the\r\ncustomer's monthly seasonal billing demand.\r\n\r\nMONTHLY BASE ENERGY AND SEASONAL ENERGY\r\nThe monthly base demand shall be lesser of the customer's monthly measured demand and the\r\ncustomer's annual base demand. The monthly seasonal demand shall be the monthly measured\r\ndemand in excess of the customer's monthly base demand. The customer's energy usage during the\r\nmonth shall be apportioned to base energy and seasonal energy in the same proportion as the\r\ncustomer's monthly base demand and seasonal demand, as defined in this paragraph. The monthly\r\nbase energy and seasonal energy shall be apportioned to the hours of use rate blocks based on the\r\nmonthly base demand and seasonal demand.", "eiaid": 12698, "enddate": 1488272400, "energycomments": "Adjustments = Demand Side Investment mechanism + Fuel Adjustment clause", "energyratestructure": [[{"adj": 0.00178, "max": 180, "rate": 0.0782, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"adj": 0.00178, "max": 360, "rate": 0.0514, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"adj": 0.00178, "rate": 0.0412, "unit": "kWh/kW"}], [{"adj": 0.00178, "max": 180, "rate": 0.052, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"adj": 0.00178, "max": 360, "rate": 0.0462, "unit": "kWh/kW"}, {"adj": 0.00178, "rate": 0.0411, "unit": "kWh/kW"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], "energyweekendschedule": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 179.01, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"rate": 9.81}], [{"rate": 7.17}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "578ffcf95457a3806bf1f983", "name": "Large Power Service-Secondary (MPS)", "peakkwcapacitymin": 500, "phasewiring": "Single and 3-Phase", "revisions": [1469032601, 1469032707, 1493367727], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "https://www.kcpl.com/~/media/Files/My%20Bill/MO%20Detailed%20Tariffs/GMO_Electric_Rates_Tariffs(042516).pdf", "sourceparent": "http://www.kcpl.com/my-bill/for-home/rate-information/mo/residential-rate-overview-gmo-mps", "startdate": 1417424400, "supersedes": "539fc940ec4f024d2f53ef2a", "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/578ffcf95457a3806bf1f983", "utility": "KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations", "voltagemaximum": 480, "voltageminimum": 120}
