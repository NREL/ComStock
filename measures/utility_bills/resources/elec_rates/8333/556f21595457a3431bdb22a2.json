APPLICABILITY This schedule is applicable to residential or general service customers with single-phase or three-phase service supplied through a meter to each individual residence or service unit. The home must have primary electric space heating and water heating separately metered and controlled with a load management switch. The member may also elect to have electric air conditioning and/or the following 240-volt (minimum 2 kW each) appliances separately metered and controlled as well: clothes dryers, hot tubs, spas, saunas, or pool heaters. The air-conditioning mode of a heat pump is automatically included for a heat pump on this rate. All the separately metered and controlled appliances and devices will automatically be switched off when the Cooperative controls peak demand with its load management system. Members are responsible for the operation of their backup heating or cooling systems and their own comfort during these control times. TYPE OF SERVICE The type of service available under this schedule shall be single-phase, 60 cycles, at 120/240 volts, and where available, three-phase at this and other secondary voltages.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Subject to a wholesale power cost adjustment.
