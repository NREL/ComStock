Renewable Generation, or Renewable Energy Resource, shall be as defined as adopted by NC G.S. 62-133.8(a)(8).\r\nService necessary for the delivery of the member's power into the Cooperative's system under this schedule shall be furnished solely to the individual contracting member in a single enterprise, located entirely on a single, contiguous premise. Service hereunder shall be restricted to the capacity of the member's generating facilities which may be operated in parallel with the Cooperative's system.\r\nService necessary to supply the member's Auxiliary Load when the member's generating facilities are not operating, shall be billed under the Energy Charges in this schedule, increased or decreased in accordance with the Wholesale Power Cost Adjustment Rider. Power delivered to the Cooperative under this schedule shall not offset or be substituted for power contracted for or which may be contracted for under any other schedule of the Cooperative.\r\nThe obligations of the Cooperative in regard to service under this Rider are dependent upon its securing and retaining all necessary rights-of-way, privileges, franchises, and permits for such service. The Cooperative shall not be liable to any member or applicant for power in the event it is delayed in, or is prevented from purchasing power by its failure to secure and retain such rights-of-way, rights, privileges, franchises, and permits. The Cooperative also reserves the right to review and determine on a case by case basis whether it has the need and system capacity to absorb the amount of proposed generation on the Cooperatives distribution system due to size and/or location.", "eiaid": 8333, "energyratestructure": [[{"rate": 0.118, "sell": 0.0565, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 15, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "556f43785457a30019db22a7", "name": "RGS General Renewable Generation Service 52G (less than 25 kW w/o Trans) - 5 Year Fixed", "peakkwcapacitymax": 25, "revisions": [1433333528, 1433333684], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "http://haywoodemc.coopwebbuilder2.com/sites/haywoodemc/files/PDF/HEMC%20Rate%20Schedules%20July%201%202014.pdf", "sourceparent": "http://www.haywoodemc.com/", "startdate": 1404201600, "supersedes": "539fca39ec4f024d2f53f9ae", "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/556f43785457a30019db22a7", "utility": "Haywood Electric Member Corp"}
