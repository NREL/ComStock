This schedule is not available for service when another commercial/industrial schedule is applicable.\n\n\nBilling Demand: The billing demand in any billing cycle will be the maximum average power taken during any metering interval in the period, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. (The customary metering interval is 15 minutes; in cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a 5-minute interval may be used.)\n\nAssignment to Schedule: If, in the judgement of the City, an account is expected to have usage over 8,000 kWh per billing cycle, the City has the option of placing the account immediately on this schedule.\n\nWhen an account billed on this schedule permanently changes the nature of electrical operations to such an extent that the account would in time qualify for another rate schedule, such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify the City of any such changes.\n\nIf energy consumption drops below 8,000 kWh and remains there for 12 consecutive billing cycles, the City will transfer the account to the appropriate schedule. If the billing demand reaches or exceeds 400 kW for three consecutive billing cycles, the account will be transferred to the appropriate rate schedule as soon as practicable. \n\n*G1-Non-profit (as defined in Federal Internal Revenue 501 (c) (3)) Industrial/Commercial customers who are currently receiving Federal Community Development Block Grant funds or have received such funds not more than two years before preparation of the current billing cycle charge are eligible for the following discount on Energy and Demand charges:\n\nJuly 1, 1996 and after: 30%\n\nIt is the customer's responsibility to notify the Finance Department of this eligibility.\n\nThis discount may not be used in conjunction with any other incentive discount. \n\n*Adjustment = California Solar Initiative Surcharge", "eiaid": 11124, "energyratestructure": [[{"adj": 0.00125, "rate": 0.11831, "unit": "kWh"}], [{"adj": 0.00125, "rate": 0.1478, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 56.38, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"rate": 3.9}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "539fbe67ec4f024c27d88637", "name": "Group 2 Commercial", "revisions": [1342451336, 1342451494, 1342451517, 1342451603, 1342451643, 1354890495, 1427405184], "sector": "Commercial", "source": "http://lodielectric.com/commercial/rateform.asp?id=11", "startdate": 1183730400, "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/539fbe67ec4f024c27d88637", "utility": "City of Lodi, California (Utility Company)"}
