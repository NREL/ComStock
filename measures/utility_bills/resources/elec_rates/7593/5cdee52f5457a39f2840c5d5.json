The BPCT is that portion of the true-up account to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. \r\n\r\nRate stabilization fund adjustment (RSFA) means funds to offset sudden and/or temporary changes in the cost of power may be deposited in or removed from a rate stabilization fund, as applicable. The RSFA is that portion of the rate stabilization fund to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. \r\n\r\n System loss factor means the factor applied to adjust the bulk power unit cost from a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of purchases to a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of sales. \r\n\r\n Power cost base means the bulk power-related cost that is embedded within the base retail rate, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy charge includes a power cost base of $0.060150 per kwh in the base rate. \r\n\r\n Bulk power cost adjustment (BPCA) means the difference between the adjusted bulk power unit cost and the power cost base, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour, as determined by the calculation.
