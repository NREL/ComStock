{"approved": true, "country": "USA", "demandrateunit": "kW", "demandunits": "kW", "description": "General service demand (commercial) means electric service to any customer for lighting, cooking, space conditioning, refrigeration and other electrical power needs. Applicable to customers who have established a monthly peak demand greater than 25 kw, but less than 1,000 kw. All service will be rendered through a single demand metering installation. \r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the service area of the electric utility of the city. Applicable to all customers who qualify for a demand rate who have operable demand meter installed\r\n\r\n*Link: Chapter 78 Utilities\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASED POWER/FUEL\r\nADJUSTMENT FACTOR \r\n\r\nApplicability. To be added to or subtracted from the rate per kwh of each filed rate schedule, and applied monthly to all energy delivered to customers of the city electric system. \r\n\r\nCalculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(BPCA BPCT RSFA) \u00d7 System Loss Factor - PCB = BPCA\r\n(kwh Purchased) \r\n\r\nDefinitions.\r\n\r\nBulk power cost (BPC) means those costs during the calculation period related to the purchase of wholesale power and the ownership of generation. \r\n\r\nBulk power cost true-up (BPCT) means the difference between the bulk power cost actually incurred and the bulk power cost recovered through the power cost base and the bulk power cost adjustment may be deposited in or removed from a true-up account, as applicable. The BPCT is that portion of the true-up account to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. \r\n\r\nRate stabilization fund adjustment (RSFA) means funds to offset sudden and/or temporary changes in the cost of power may be deposited in or removed from a rate stabilization fund, as applicable. The RSFA is that portion of the rate stabilization fund to be recovered from or returned to customers through the calculated BPCA. \r\n\r\nSystem loss factor means the factor applied to adjust the bulk power unit cost from a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of purchases to a basis of cost per kilowatt-hour of sales. \r\n\r\nPower cost base means the bulk power-related cost that is embedded within the base retail rate, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy charge includes a power cost base of $0.060150 per kwh in the base rate. \r\n\r\nBulk power cost adjustment (BPCA) means the difference between the adjusted bulk power unit cost and the power cost base, stated in cost per kilowatt-hour, as determined by the calculation.
