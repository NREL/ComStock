If this schedule is used for farm service and residential electric usage is measured through the same meter to which this schedule applies, the following credit will be given: $6.90/Month\r\n\r\nMembers whose usage exceeds 15,000 kWh for two consecutive months shall be billed on this rate. \r\n\r\nBilling Demand Charge: The billing demand shall be the highest measured 15-minute demand in kilowatts during the billing period, but not less than 80% of the highest billing demand during the preceding eleven months.\r\n\r\nPOWER FACTOR: The customer agrees to maintain, as nearly as practicable, a unity power factor. For members whose usage exceeds 30,000 kWh per month for two consecutive months and whose average power factor for any billing month is less than 95% lagging, an adjustment shall be added to the customer's bill to reflect the lower power factor as follows:\r\n\r\nAdjustment = Maximum Demand (0.05 + Power Factory) - Maximum Demand x Demand Charge\r\n\r\nWhere the maximum demand is the highest measured 15-minute demand in kilowatts during the billing period. Such adjustment will be made two months after determination and notification by the Cooperative of power factor deficiency.\r\n\r\nPrimary service will be provided and a discount of 5% will apply to members who own, operate and maintain the necessary transformers, switches, and protective equipment. Primary service is restricted to members whose usage exceeds 30,000 kWh per month. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlat rate Adjustments= EEC ($0.00513) \r\n\r\nDemand Charge ($21.1038) = Billing Demand Charge ($20.29) + EEC ($0.8138)", "dgrules": "Net Metering", "eiaid": 19791, "energycomments": "adjustment = Energy Efficiency Charge.\r\nhttp://psb.vermont.gov/sites/psbnew/files/doc_library/attachment-to-order-re-current-eec-rates.pdf", "energyratestructure": [[{"adj": 0.00772, "rate": 0.09066, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 30.44, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"adj": 1.2436, "rate": 20.88}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "label": "5908b06b5457a39c4b5789ff", "name": "Rate 2: General Service Rate-DEMAND BILLING PROVISION (Commercial)", "peakkwcapacityhistory": 1, "peakkwcapacitymax": 500, "peakkwhusagehistory": "2", "peakkwhusagemin": 15000, "revisions": [1493720075, 1493720248], "sector": "Commercial", "servicetype": "Bundled", "source": "http://www.vermontelectric.coop/images/pdf/vec-tariff-effective-01-01-2017-rev1.pdf", "sourceparent": "http://www.vermontelectric.coop/", "startdate": 1483261200, "supersedes": "575ed4ef5457a36123ba0c12", "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/5908b06b5457a39c4b5789ff", "utility": "Vermont Electric Cooperative, Inc."}
