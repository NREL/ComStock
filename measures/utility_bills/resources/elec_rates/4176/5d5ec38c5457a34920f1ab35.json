Customers with maximum demands that are equal to\r\nor greater than 200 kW, but are less than 350 kW, must take service under Rate 27 or Rate 37,\r\nand are not eligible to return to Rate 30 or Rate 35 if their maximum demands drop below 200\r\nkW, per DPUC decision in Docket No. 05-10-03. Service will be metered at one point by one\r\ninstallation of meters. The meter location will be determined by the Company. Where the\r\nCompany deems it impractical to deliver electricity through one service, or where more than one\r\nmeter has been installed for billing under a withdrawn rate, then the measurement of electricity\r\nmay be by two or more meters.", "dgrules": "Net Metering", "eiaid": 4176, "enddate": 1656576000, "energycomments": "Rate = Distribution Service | Adjustments = Electric System Improvement Charge + Revenue Adjustment Mechanism + Transmission Charge + Combined Public Benefits Charge + Competitive Transition Assessment Charge + FMCC Delivery Charge", "energyratestructure": [[{"adj": 0.01445, "rate": 0, "unit": "kWh"}]], "energyweekdayschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "energyweekendschedule": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "fixedchargefirstmeter": 270, "fixedchargeunits": "$/month", "flatdemandmonths": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "flatdemandstructure": [[{"adj": 8.66, "rate": 8.54}]], "flatdemandunit": "kW", "is_default": false, "label": "5d5ec38c5457a34920f1ab35", "name": "Rate 35 Intermediate General Electric Service", "peakkwcapacitymax": 200, "revisions": [1566469932, 1566469970, 1660835070], "sector": "Commercial", "servicetype": "Delivery", "source": "https://www.eversource.com/content/docs/default-source/rates-tariffs/ct-electric-rates.pdf?sfvrsn=2d9afe62_6", "sourceparent": "https://www.eversource.com/content/ct-c/residential/my-account/billing-payments/about-your-bill/rates-and-tariffs/electric-tariffs-rules", "startdate": 1561968000, "supersedes": "5b84460d5457a3c32bedfe00", "uri": "https://apps.openei.org/IURDB/rate/view/5d5ec38c5457a34920f1ab35", "utility": "Connecticut Light & Power Co", "voltagecategory": "Secondary"}
