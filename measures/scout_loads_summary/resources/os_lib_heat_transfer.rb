    # Per the EnergyPlus Engineering Reference for Solar Distribution type = 'FullExterior` (E+ IDD default value):
    #
    #   All beam solar radiation entering the zone is assumed to fall on the floor, where it is absorbed according to the floorâ€™s solar absorptance.
    #   Any reflected by the floor is added to the transmitted diffuse radiation, which is assumed to be uniformly distributed on all interior surfaces.
    #   If no floor is present in the zone, the incident beam solar radiation is absorbed on all interior surfaces according to their absorptances.
    #   The zone heat balance is then applied at each surface and on the zoneâ€™s air with the absorbed radiation being treated as a flux on the surface.
    #
    # This means that temperature of the ground/floor (which results in convection) is caused by a combination of previously absorbed
    # solar radiation and current timestep conduction from the temperature difference between the ground/floor and the soil/zone below.
