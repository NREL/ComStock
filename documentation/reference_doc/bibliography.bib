Basic information regarding the commercial-building population, such as floor space, age, HVAC type, and energy consumption, will aid in properly targeting these RandD efforts. The categories developed in this study allow users to focus studies for gas-fired equipment on specific segments of the nations office building sector. Categories of office buildings were developed using a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, which was used to group observations on the basis of similarities with respect to various attributes. Categories were defined on the basis of physical attributes such as size, age, and location and on building energy loads. The categories were designed to represent the entire office-building sector with a limited number of categories while reflecting as much of the diversity within the sector with respect to energy as possible.},

Based on a review of various infiltration modeling options available in EnergyPlus and sensitivity analysis, the linear wind velocity coefficient based on DOE-2 infiltration model is recommended. The methodology described in this report can be used to calculate the EnergyPlus infiltration input for any given building level infiltration rate specified at known pressure difference. The sensitivity analysis shows that EnergyPlus calculates the wind speed based on zone altitude, and the linear wind velocity coefficient represents the variation in infiltration heat loss consistent with building location and weather data.},

Those enhancements are described here and were made for several reasons: (1) to change or improve prototype design assumptions; (2) to improve the simulation accuracy; (3) to improve the simulation infrastructure; and (4) to add additional detail to the models needed to capture certain energy impacts from Standard 90.1 improvements. These enhancements impact simulated prototype energy use, and consequently impact the savings estimated from edition to edition of Standard 90.1.},

abstractNote = {The United States is embarking on an ambitious transition to a 100\% clean energy economy by 2050, which will require improving the flexibility of electric grids. One way to achieve grid flexibility is to shed or shift demand to align with changing grid needs. To facilitate this, it is critical to understand how and when energy is used. High- quality end-use load profiles (EULPs) provide this information, and can help cities, states, and utilities understand the time-sensitive value of energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed energy resources. Publicly available EULPs have traditionally had limited application because of age and incomplete geographic representation (Frick, Eckman, and Goldman 2017; Frick 2019). To help fill this gap, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project - End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock - that culminated in the release of a publicly available dataset1 of simulated EULPs representing residential and commercial buildings across the contiguous United States. The motivation for this work is further detailed in a November 2019 report: Market Needs, Use Cases, and Data Gaps (Mims Frick et al. 2019). This Methodology and Results report provides detailed descriptions of how the dataset was developed, intended for an audience of dataset and model users interested in the technical details. These details include descriptions of all of the model improvements made for calibration and the final comparisons to empirical data sources. A companion report, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock: Applications and Opportunities, will be published subsequently and will describe example applications and considerations for using the dataset, intended for an audience of general dataset users.},

author = {Crowe, Eliot and Chen, Yimin and Granderson, Jessica and Reeve, Hayden and Troup, Lucas and Yuill, David and Chen, Yuxuan},
abstractNote = {To achieve ambitious decarbonization goals it is critical that buildings operate to their full potential. Commercial HVAC systems, however, experience a wide range of operational faults, adversely affecting energy consumption, occupant comfort, and maintenance costs. Analytical tools such as fault detection & diagnostics (FDD) software identify and help diagnose these types of sensing, mechanical, or control-related faults. While significant energy savings has been documented for FDD, along with limited-scale studies on technical capabilities, there is a lack of empirical data on faults being reported by FDD tools. With FDD deployment accelerating significantly over the past decade there is an opportunity to gather and analyze data on commercial HVAC operational problems at an unprecedented scale. Such data could address many questions such as: [a] What faults are most commonly reported?; and [b] How does fault reporting vary by time of year and other possible drivers? A recent study into FDD fault reporting amassed the largest U.S. dataset of commercial HVAC air-side fault records, drawn from multi-year monitoring across over 60,000 pieces of HVAC equipment. The results of this study provide granular data on fault reporting for over 90 unique fault types. In this paper we provide an overview of the research process and highlight key findings and lessons learned. This study presents an extraordinary level of detail on FDD fault reporting characteristics across many climate zones and building types. Armed with these new insights, commercial building industry stakeholders can make better informed decisions when designing, configuring, and operating commercial HVAC systems.},

author = {Katipamula, Srinivas and Underhill, Ronald M. and Fernandez, Nicholas EP and Kim, Woohyun and Lutes, Robert G. and Taasevigen, Danny J.},
abstractNote = {In the United States, as much as 30% of the 19 EJ that commercial buildings consume is considered excess. Much of the excess energy is due to the inability to manage building operations efficiently. Because almost 20% of the total primary energy consumption is associated with commercial buildings, significant energy reductions in this sector are needed to mitigate climate change. Therefore, many cities and states are mandating periodic “tune-ups” of these buildings to eliminate excess energy consumption. Although the benefits of tune-ups and retro-commissioning are clear, focusing these mandates to look for specific opportunities has been a challenge because of the lack of studies that document the prevalence of opportunities. Therefore, we analyzed building automation system data from 151 buildings across the United States to document common operational problems and opportunities to improve building operations. This analysis showed that opportunities to improve building operations exist in almost every building. These opportunities were not strongly correlated with building vintage or size, but were reflective of how the buildings are operated. The prevalence of the top 20 opportunities ranged between 74% and 23%, with 40% of these associated with air-handling units. The rest of the opportunities are associated with schedules, chilled and hot-water distribution, and zone controls. Of the 151 buildings, 69 of them implemented corrective actions of some or all opportunities that were identified. Implementation varied across the Re-tuning categories, with 60% for schedule opportunities, 50% for zone opportunities, over 40% for the air-handling unit and hot-water opportunities, and 35% of the chilled-water opportunities. There was wide variation in whole building energy savings, ranging from 0 to 50% and 0 to 18 $/m2 with median percent annual whole building savings of 12% and median normalized annual cost savings of $1.75/m2. In addition to documenting these key findings, the paper provides a list of opportunities that can be automatically and continuously identified and corrected and offers a list of those opportunities that should be the focus of the mandates.},

title = {Analysis of Fault Data Collected from Automated Fault Detection and Diagnostic Products for Packaged Rooftop Units},
author = {Shoukas, Greg and Bianchi, Marcus and Deru, Michael},
abstractNote = {Rooftop units (RTUs) and other packaged systems are very common in commercial buildings in the U.S., and they often have minimal controls and poor performance. Automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) is a powerful tool that can continuously monitor operating equipment, detect abnormal performance, diagnose problems, and report findings to building operators. AFDD technologies for RTUs have been under development for many years and have recently begun to enter the market in a significant way. There are several AFDD systems available for RTUs that feature a wide range of designs, capabilities, and reporting. Unfortunately, there is little consistency among the AFDD applications and little understanding of the performance and value of these systems. This study presents analysis of AFDD data provided by four companies from over 28,000 RTUs, five building types, and multiple climate zones. The objectives of this investigation were to gain a better understanding of how RTU AFDD systems operate, the types and frequencies of faults identified, and how building operators interact with these systems. The monitoring of a variety of RTUs provides insights into the AFDD monitoring inputs, faults, and diagnostics from which these tools are capable of informing building owners about the status of their HVAC systems.},
