ComStock owes its conceptual underpinnings to ResStock\textsuperscript{TM}, particularly to the work of ResStock's originators Craig Christensen, Scott Horowitz, and Eric Wilson of NREL. ComStock has been developed over many years, and has benefited from the leadership and guidance of many DOE staff, including Jason Hartke, Andrew Burr, Amy Jiron, Harry Bergmann, and Amir Roth. Additionally, ComStock has been improved upon through work for parties outside of DOE, most notably the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, where support and feedback from Armen Saiyan has been instrumental in key improvements to the tool. Lastly, ComStock would not be possible without the EnergyPlus\textsuperscript{TM} whole-building energy modeling tool and the OpenStudio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Software Development Kit, two pieces of software that are the result of many years of hard work by a large number of people at DOE, the national laboratories, and the private sector.
