\hline
\textbf{Database Type}& \textbf{Percent of Entries} & \textbf{ComStock Type} & \textbf{Note} \\ \hline
FRAME                         & 24.96\%  & SteelFramed & We believe that this mostly represents steel stud construction based on a survey of samples of this type \\ \hline
WOOD                          & 23.93\%  & WoodFramed  & Clearly meets wood-framed wall definition \\ \hline
MASONRY                       & 20.78\%  & Mass        & Could be CMU or brick veneer; both meet the definition of mass wall \\ \hline
STEEL                         & 8.48\%   & SteelFramed & We believe that this mostly indicates curtain wall with steel framing for tall buildings, and steel stud for shorter buildings \\ \hline
BRICK                         & 6.01\%   & Mass        & Could either be structural brick or brick veneer; both meet the definition of mass wall \\ \hline
OTHER                         & 4.49\%   & No Match    & Meaning unclear \\ \hline
CONCRETE BLOCK                & 4.48\%   & Mass        & Clearly meets mass wall definition \\ \hline
CONCRETE                      & 3.34\%   & Mass        & Clearly meets mass wall definition \\ \hline
TILT-UP (PRE-CAST CONCRETE)   & 1.59\%   & Mass        & Clearly meets mass wall definition \\ \hline
METAL                         & 1.26\%   & Metal Building  & Clearly meets metal building definition \\ \hline
STONE                         & 0.22\%   & No Match    & Inconsistent, but often used to describe buildings with a small percentage of decorative stone veneer around the base of the wall. Insignificant fraction of stock \\ \hline
MIXED                         & 0.21\%   & No Match    & Meaning unclear from survey, and insignificant fraction \\ \hline
LOG                           & 0.09\%   & No Match    & Insignificant fraction \\ \hline
LIGHT                         & 0.07\%   & No Match    & Insignificant fraction \\ \hline
ADOBE                         & 0.04\%   & No Match    & Insignificant fraction \\ \hline
MANUFACTURED                  & 0.03\%   & No Match    & Meaning unclear from survey, and insignificant fraction \\ \hline

DOME                          & 0.00\%   & No Match    & Meaning unclear from survey, and insignificant fraction \\ \hline
