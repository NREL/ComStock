In the individual model output time series data, the timestamp is reported out in local time, Daylight Standard Time, and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In ComStock, the time series results for all buildings are all converted to Eastern Standard Time (EST) for publication. For buildings whose local time is not EST, the last few hours of the data set are moved to the beginning of the time series to ensure a full year of data. \\ \hline
