\subsection{EnergyPlus Simulation Settings}

The EnergyPlus simulation settings are a crucial part of any run because they set the length of the run, the calendar year, the number of time steps, and a number of other inputs. A list of all the simulation settings used in ComStock and their descriptions is shown in Table~\ref{tab:simulation_settings}.
